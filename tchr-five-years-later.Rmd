# 1 Introduction: The contact hypothesis, seventy years later

Seventy years on, Gordon Allport's 'The Nature of Prejudice' remains seminal. Perhaps its most influential idea is 'the contact hypothesis,' the idea that contact between groups can help reduce tensions between them. However, Allport did not believe that just any contact would do, and was careful to distinguish between "casual contact" and "true acquaintance" [@allport1954, p. XXX]. In order to have true acquaintance, Allport argued, contact needed to meet four additional conditions: the support of authorities, shared goals, cooperation, and equal status. This theory would predict that, for instance, sharing a commuter rail station with Latino immigrants would do nothing to decreases whites' anti-immigrant sentiments [@enos2014], while being assigned to play cricket with a member of a different caste \textemdash a setting where the four conditions are met \textemdash would reduce hostilities [@lowe2021].

Nearly two decades ago, an influential meta-analysis by @pettigrew2006 reviewed hundreds of contact studies, comprising hundreds of thousands of subjects, and found that contact "typically reduces intergroup prejudice" (p. 751). Moreover, Allport's facilitating conditions were evidently not necessary for positive effects: “samples with no claim to these key conditions still show significant relationships between contact and prejudice” (p. 766). Overall, they write, “[t]here is little need to demonstrate further contact's general ability to lessen prejudice. Results from the meta-analysis conclusively show that intergroup contact can promote reductions in intergroup prejudice” (p. 751).

Five years ago, my colleagues and I published 'The contact Hypothesis Re-evaluated' [@paluck2019], an updated meta-analysis with an amended methodological focus. Rather than looking at the entirety of contact literature, we focused exclusively on randomized controlled trials with at least a day of delay between the commencement of treatment and outcome measurement.

In the main, we found that contact did indeed typically reduce prejudice in the assembled studies, reinforcing the central contention of @pettigrew2006. However, we also uncovered four grounds for skepticism about when and where worked did its magic.

First, our measured effect sizes were not robust to two measures of study quality. In our sample, the larger the study, the smaller the effect, and studies with pre-analysis plans had a tiny, null effect on average. Second, there was significant heterogeneity between targets of prejudice. The most effective interventions were those aimed at reducing prejudice against people with disabilities, while studies aimed at ethnic, racial, religious and anti-immigrant sentiment were generally less effective, though still statistically significant on average. Third, we found lacunae. The most troubling was the total absence of studies looking at interracial prejudice in people over 25. Fourth, there were no systematic variations of Allport's facilitating conditions.

It has now been five years since that piece was published, and eight since we stopped collecting data. The question of what reduces prejudice between groups has not lost any of its urgency and vitality. So what have we learned since then?

# A welcome proliferation of field experiments (that find mixed effects)

Our meta-analysis was fortuitously timed in that it coincided with the publication of some very impressive papers featuring rigorous and naturalistic tests of contact in settings where assuaging tensions is of the utmost importance. Two notable papers used intergroup sports to get groups to cooperate: inter-caste cricket in India [@lowe2021] or soccer for Christians and Muslims in Iraq [@mousa2020]. Another is educational settings, e.g. pairing "minority Roma and majority non-Roma Hungarians" students' desk pairings [@elwert2023] or native-born Austrians and refugees for a school-based workshop on fleeing one's home and prejudice [@nagele2023]. Finally, @grady2023 tested a contact intervention, led by Mercy Corps, intended to bridge divides between farmers and pa storalists in middle belt Nigeria, the site of prior violent conflict. These studies build on the latest, most rigorous studies that we meta-analyzed (e.g. @scacco2018, @broockman2016) in forming a new standard for contact experiments.[^1]

[^1]: As @boin2021 writes, "Overall, Paluck and colleagues’ (2019) call for improved standards in research on intergroup contact has already inspired methodologically more sound studies" (p. 117).

And notably, they find much more mixed effects than the studies that came before. @lowe2021 finds that playing together creates new friendships and reduces ingroup favoritism, but @elwert2023 find, essentially, no results. @mousa2021 finds positive effects within the context of soccer, but very little that generalized. @nagele2023 find positive effects, but also found positive effects for the version of the intervention that did not have contact. Finally @grady2023 found positive effects on stated attitudes, but no detectable effects on behaviors.

To the contact hypothesis's most avid boosters, I ask: what is going on here? Our meta-analysis inspired some rather critical rejoinders, e.g. @pettigrew2021, but truly, it is *these* studies, and their middling findings, that most call out for an explanation.

Here is my own.

# Disambiguating prejudice

In its plain language use, the word 'prejudice' connotes 'pre-judgment:' assessing someone before you know them based on group characteristics. In other words, it's about ignorance and a lack of experience.

In our meta-analysis, the most effective interventions are aimed at prejudices that plausibly be attributed to ignorance: against the elderly, people who are blind, or coworkers with intellectual disabilities. But the same cannot be said about, e.g., @scacco2018, where members of both groups experienced racial riots, or @mousa2020, where Christians had recently experienced ethnic cleansing at the hands of the Islamic State. In other words, Imagine that you had just lived through a pogrom, and now you were being paid to join a soccer league with members of the perpetrators' clan. Would that change your attitudes towards the group as a whole?

We need a richer theory, I think, for the multitude of feelings of intergroup antipathy based on their severity. For instance, we might reserve 'prejudice' for negative feelings that can plausibly be attributed to ignorance and a lack of experience. For someone who has had real life, but not severe, negative experiences with the outgroup, perhaps we could use hostility. And for feelings of severe dislike, I would use animus or antipathy.

My working theory for the contact hypothesis is that intergroup contact is effective at reducing prejudice, moderately effective at reducing hostility, and not well-suited for reducing animus. For the worse disease, we need stronger medicine. (Sustained economic cooperation and a shared commitment to a 'truth and reconciliation' mindset come to mind.)

# Light touch interventions for light touch prejudice

In parallel to a new generation of contact field experiments, many scholars are exploring the boundaries of what my colleagues call 'light touch interventions' [@paluck2021]].

-   imagined contact, online contact, VR contact, etc. are all clearly not well suited for antipathy. If you see evidence of these strategies working, it means either a shallow prejudice (women with autism) or some questionable research practices.

# We still need systematic tests of the facilitating conditions
